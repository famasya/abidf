        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>I have been working as a CTO at Trustmedis since 2019, a company that transitioned from a software house to a healthtech provider specializing in health information systems for healthcare providers. We have been partnering with <a href="https://setkab.go.id/inilah-prosedur-layanan-telemedisin-bagi-pasien-isolasi-mandiri-terkonfirmasi-omicron/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">government entities</a> and <a href="https://news.detik.com/adv-nhl-detikcom/d-6200556/virtu-digilab-national-research-center-fasilitas-penelitian-terbaik-ri" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">big companies</a> to develop digital health technology. My primary role has been to transition our project-based system into SaaS products, which now serve millions of patients nationwide.</p>
        <p>
          I hold a Master's degree in Informatics from ITS Surabaya, Indonesia, with a specialization in natural language processing. As part of my thesis, I developed the first <a href="https://huggingface.co/abid/indonesia-bioner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER) model in Bahasa Indonesia</a>, designed to identify biomedical entities in free-text data. I've also conducted research in other areas, including the Internet of Underwater Things and network security.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wrangled Jupyter Notebook daily to explore Transformer architectures, building on top of libraries like FlairNLP and Transformers, including scratch implementations in PyTorch.

        <p>
          I believe that humans should be the boss of machines.
        </p>
        <p>
          I build tools under the name <a href="https://automagic.abidf.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automagic Systems</a>: a personal lab focused on automation of boring tasks. My first product, <a href="https://zenfin.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zenfin</a>, is a WhatsApp-based personal finance tracker that turns casual chats and receipts into clean financial insights using LLMs. Automagic explores ideas at the intersection of natural language, small tools, and everyday workflows.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond my work, I've been actively involved in civic and academic communities. I contributed to <a href="https://kawalcovid19.id" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KawalCovid19</a>, a grassroots initiative supporting transparent and responsible information dissemination during the COVID-19 pandemic, and <a href="https://evoina.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evoina.org</a>, an organization advocating for scientific research and evolutionary biology in Indonesia.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also occasionally teach as a guest lecturer, teaching Database Design and Health Informatics, where I share industry practices and research-backed insights to help students build practical, scalable systems in the healthcare domain.
